# This program will help align sequences in any FASTA format sequence alignment file.
# You can replace any set of characters with any other set of characters, but
# this means that non-canonical characters can be used. Also, any sequence with the 
# search motif you provide will be affected. There is no 'undo', so save often or
# add your own error-capturing procedures.
#
# This was part of a much larger program, with many different subroutines, hence the
# strangely empty main directory.
#
# No copyright, but this was written by Robert Carter, circa 2020
# I intentionally made this as generic as possible, there are not many of the typically 
# cryptic, "perlish" statements here. Anyone with a grasp of programming should be able 
# to easily adapt this to another language.
