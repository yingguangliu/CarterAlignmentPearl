The first 'sequence' in each alignment file is the amino acid translation of the reference strain.
Asterisks denote non-coding nucleotides.
Each amino acid is represented by its single-letter code, repeated three times.
Stop codons are denoted with "XXX".
Gaps caused by insertions among the included sequences are denoted by "-" and are carried over into the AA strand.

The first real sequence is the reference strain (NC_045512.2, aka "Wuhan-1). This is included in each alignment file.

Following that are ~800 sequences. The sequences were downloaded and processed in batches: spring 2020, summer 2020, fall 2020, and winter 2021.
Thus, the sequence files and the sequences contained therein are roughly in chronological order, but this order represents the date of upload
to GenBank, not the infection date or sequencing date. Also, there are fewer than 800 sequences in the final file for each batch.

Each file is locally degapped. You will have to handle this yourself if you wish to combine files.
